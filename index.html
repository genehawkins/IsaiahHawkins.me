        <p>I had started programming in high school, It was there I was exposed to HTML. We were assigned to make a website
          that had one page, it was after seeing that page I had created when I realized that I wanted to learn more about programming.
          I would go on to learn Python, C++, and Java, with a preference to Java. I love learning and seeing new ways to program,
          such as making games, learning about cybersecurity, and having fun with programming in general. I strive to learn more on
          programming and being able to see what I programmed working is a feeling I will always love.</p></td>
